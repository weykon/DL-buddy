1. Fully Connected Layer (FCN) It ​​connects every input node to every node of the output layer.


2. Pooling Layer: The pooling layer is usually used in convolutional neural networks (CNN) to reduce the dimensionality and complexity of data. The most common pooling operations are Max Pooling and Average Pooling.


3. Normalization Layer: The normalization layer is used to standardize the input data so that it has zero mean and unit variance. This helps improve model training speed and performance. For example, Batch Normalization.


4. Activation Layer: The activation layer is used to introduce nonlinear functions, such as ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh, etc. This allows neural networks to learn and represent more complex patterns.


5. Dropout layer: The Dropout layer randomly turns off some neurons during the training process to prevent overfitting.


6. Embedding Layer1. Fully Connected Layer (FCN) It ​​connects every input node to every node of the output layer.
